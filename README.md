# ThermoShift
 
Thermoshift is a Top-Down arcade adventure game where the player can switch a thermostat from hot and cold to solve puzzles, fight enemies and explore.  

The player can activate a magic handheld thermostat to change temperature.  
Changing temperature causes the environment and enemies to change. These changes happen primarily through blocks - Red, Blue, Ice etc. - that shift on and off depending on the temperature. 

This game was made as a final project in our Advanced Game Programming class. 
All code, sound effects visual assets were made by us, however the background music is borrowed from _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to The Past_ and  _Final Fantasy 16_
